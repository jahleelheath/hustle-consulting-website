# Resume Prompt

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Paste this exactly into a new session to pick up where we left off:

```
I'm building the H.U.S.T.L.E Consulting LLC website. Read `/Users/jahleel/hustle-consulting-website/HANDOFF.md` for full context, then read the implementation plan at `/Users/jahleel/AI-Knowledgebase/docs/superpowers/plans/2026-04-10-hustle-consulting-website.md`. Tasks 1, 2, and 3 are complete. Continue from Task 4.

IMPORTANT: Use subagent-driven development throughout. For every task:
1. Dispatch a fresh implementer subagent with the full task text + context (never let it read the plan itself — provide all needed content directly in the prompt)
2. After the implementer reports DONE, dispatch a spec compliance reviewer subagent — it reads the relevant files and verifies everything in the spec was built and nothing extra was added. It must return VERDICT: ✅ SPEC COMPLIANT or VERDICT: ❌ ISSUES FOUND with a bullet list.
3. Only after spec passes, dispatch a code quality reviewer subagent — it checks for bugs, correctness issues, accessibility problems, and code quality. It returns VERDICT: ✅ APPROVED or VERDICT: ❌ NEEDS FIXES with required changes.
4. If either reviewer finds issues, dispatch the implementer to fix them, then re-run the relevant reviewer. Do not proceed to the next task until both reviews pass.
5. After all tasks are complete, run a final full-codebase reviewer before closing out.

This two-stage review process is critical — it has already caught real bugs and accessibility issues in this project.

### What Task 3 produced

- **`Nav.astro`**: A sophisticated, fixed top navigation bar.
  - Glassmorphic design (`backdrop-filter: blur`, semi-transparent background).
  - Dynamic scroll listener that deepens border opacity on scroll.
  - Active page detection with `aria-current="page"`.
  - Responsive visibility (links hidden on mobile, shown on `md:` breakpoints).
  - Premium "Book a Call" CTA with hover transitions.
- **`Footer.astro`**: A minimal, elegant footer strip.
  - Subtle red top border.
  - Branded tagline and copyright information.
  - Correct text color inheritance and accessibility labels.

## Subagent-Driven Development Process

This project mandates a multi-stage subagent review workflow for every task. This process was established during Task 3 to ensure high-quality, spec-compliant code.

### The Workflow

1.  **IMPLEMENTER**: Creates the code based on the task description.
2.  **SPEC COMPLIANCE REVIEWER**: Verifies all requirements are met and no extra code was added. Returns a binary verdict.
3.  **CODE QUALITY REVIEWER**: Checks for bugs, accessibility (A11y), responsive design issues, and idiomatic code patterns.

### Rationale: Why we do this

AI agents often focus on completing the functional task but may miss subtle "production-grade" details. This workflow creates a "checks and balances" system that prevents technical debt from accumulating.

### Specific Bugs Caught in Task 3

The subagent review process proved its value immediately by catching the following issues in Task 3:
- **Responsive Layout**: Nav links were overlapping on mobile devices; fixed by hiding them behind a menu/breakpoint.
- **Accessibility (A11y)**: Missing `aria-current="page"` on active links, which is critical for screen readers.
- **Semantic HTML**: Missing `aria-label` on the header `<nav>` element and the logo link.
- **CSS Fragility**: The footer copyright text relied on implicit parent colors which caused it to disappear on certain background transitions; fixed by explicitly setting color vars.
